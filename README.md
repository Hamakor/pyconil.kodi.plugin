Files for PyCon-IL.TV (PyCon Israel 2017 Kodi Addon Workshop)

The project contains two addons, and some sample files to be used in
various stages of the workshop. The addons are:

* `plugin.video.workshoptest` - an empty template for video plugins, 
  intended to be installed by participants at the start, and gradually
  adding functionality by editing, using the sample files provided here.
  
* `plugin.video.pyconil` - the demo plugin. If/when participants finish 
  the original workshop plan, they can join in and help us developing this.

To install the plugins, first zip them:

 `zip -r plugin.video.pyconil{.zip,}`

Then use Kodi's UI to install the zip.
